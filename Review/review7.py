# (From end of lesson) Write a function that takes in the four lists of the class test scores and determines who's class has the highest average
# Print their name and their class average


# Write a function that takes in the four lists of the class test scores and determines which class had the most A's (scores 90 and above)
# Print their name and the number of A's in their class


# Write a function that takes in a list and a number and returns the number of times that number is present in the list
# example: function([1,2,3,4,5], 6) would return 0 because 6 is not in the list
# example: function([1,2,1,3,4,1,5,10,1,1,1,1], 1) would return 7


# Write a function that takes in 2 lists and prints out values present in both lists
# example: function([1,2,3], [3,2,1]) would print 1,2,3 (the order doesn't matter and they don't have to be printed on the same line)
# example: function([1,3,5,7], [2,3,4,5]) would print 3,5
