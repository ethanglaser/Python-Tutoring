## All problems here will involve manyWords.txt (or whatever you named the 10000 word file)

# Write a function that prints out how many words start and end with the same letter


# Write a function that takes in a letter and finds how many words contain 2 or more of that letter
# For example, function('s') would count 'snakes' and 'hisses' towards its total ()
# Example: function('s') = 837


# Write a function that takes in a letter and a number and prints out how many words start with that letter and are that long
# Example: function('a', 1) = 1
# Example: function('e', 4) = 31
