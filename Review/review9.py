# Write a function that adds two input integers and then prints out a sentence describing the operation
# hint: use the str() function to convert numeric values to strings
# example: function(1,3) would print '1 plus 3 equals 4'
# example: function(5,5) would print '5 plus 5 equals 10'


# Write a function that takes in a list of words and prints out a shrunk version of that lists that only includes 
# words from the original list that have 4 letters or fewer
# example: function('one,two,three,four') would return 'one,two,four'
# example: function('math,science,art,english') would return 'math,art'


# Write a function that takes in a word and prints out the pig latin version of the word
# You can assume that the first sound will only consist of one letter and the the first letter will be a consonant
# example: function('hello') would return 'ello hay'
# example: function('python') would return 'ython pay'

# Write a function that takes in a paragraph/section of text and prints the shortest word from the longest sentence
# example: function('This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are cool. Paragraphs have many sentences. Sentences have many words. Therefore, each paragraph has a lot of words.')
#    would print 'a' because the last sentence is the longest and 'a' is the shortest word in the sentence
