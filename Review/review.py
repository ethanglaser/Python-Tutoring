'''
To review what we covered today, I created a Python file with some prompts for functions to write (I wrote two of them as an example)
If you run this file without modifying it, 2 lines should be printed in the terminal:

Code is running
12


Reminders:
Variable can be named whatever you want, but once they are named they can only be referenced by the name you originally gave them
The same applies for function names - you can name them anything
Call the functions from main to run them
Remember that functions are declared using "def" and require parentheses and a colon
The code inside a function should be tabbed over
Setting a variable requires a single equals-sign and the variable name should be on the left with its value on the right of the =

#Write and call a function from main called "sample" that prints that the code is running
def sample():
    print("Code is running")


#Write a function that prints "Hi my name is ___" with your name in the blank


#Write a function that prints the grade you are going into and the school you go to on separate lines


#Write a function that sets a variable to your favorite number and prints it
def favoritenumber():
    favorite = 12
    print(favorite)


#Write a function that finds the sum of two numbers (you can pick the numbers) and prints that sum


#Write a function that prints that sets variables for two numbers, then print the product of those numbers


#Write a function that prints the adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides 6 and 3 and print the 4 results on separate lines


#Write a function that prints the result of 5^2 and 6^3 (remember that ^ is not the python command for exponents)


#Write a function that sets variables to 2 integers and then find the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number



if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample()
    favoritenumber()
