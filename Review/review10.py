## All problems here will involve manyWords.txt (or whatever you named the 10000 word file)

# Write out a function that prints out the number of words in the file that are over 10 letters long


# Write a function to determine whether the letter q, x, or z appears least in the entire file


# Write a function that takes in a letter and prints out the number of words in the file that start with that letter
# example: function('a') would print 720
